# Peer-graded-Assignment-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Peer graded assignment for final week 
+Project of [Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata), May 2014 edition.
+
+## Project Description
+The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
+The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers
+on a series of yes/no questions related to the project.
+
+You will be required to submit:
+
+1. a tidy data set as described below
+2. a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and
+3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or
+   work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also
+   include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This file explains how all
+   of the scripts work and how they are connected. 
+
+One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing.
+Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced
+algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent
+data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
+A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
+http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
+
+Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
+
+You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
+
+* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
+* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
+* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
+* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
+* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
+
+## What you find in this repository
+
+* __CodeBook.md__: information about raw and tidy data set and elaboration made to
+  transform them
+* __LICENSE__: license terms for text and code
+* __README.md__: this file
+* __run_analysis.R__: R script to transform raw data set in a tidy one
+
+## How to create the tidy data set
+
+1. clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:maurotrb/getting-cleaning-data-2014-project.git`
+2. download [compressed raw data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
+3. unzip raw data and copy the directory `UCI HAR Dataset` to the cloned repository root directory
+4. open a R console and set the working directory to the repository root (use setwd())
+5. source run_analisys.R script (it requires the plyr package): `source('run_analysis.R')`
+
+In the repository root directory you find the file `sensor_avg_by_act_sub.txt` with the tidy data set.
